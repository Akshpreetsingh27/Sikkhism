      <h1>GURU ANGAD DEVJI</h1>
      <p>
        Born in Matte-di-Sarai in the Ferozepur district in a very poor family, he was 45 when he came to the Throne of Nanak. He continued the work of Guru Nanak for thirteen years after him. His chief contribution to the Sikh movement was his insistence on absolute surrender to God, humility, and dedicated service to humanity. It is recorded that it was he who gave vogue to the native script of Panjabi, Gurmukhi, and got the sayings and a biography of his Master written in this script, though the script was known and widely used even before him by the Khatris for keeping their accounts. Before him, Guru Nanak too had rejected Sanskrit, in preference to the indigenous spoken languages of the people, Panjabi and Hindi, as the great Buddha had done before by making Pali, then the vernacular of North India, the vehicle of his message. This dealt a severe blow to the hereditary priestly class.
