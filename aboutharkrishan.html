   <h1>GURU HARKRISHAN JI</h1>
      <p>
        Guru Harkrishan Sahib Ji (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰੂ ਹਰਿਕ੍ਰਿਸ਼ਨ ਸਾਹਿਬ ਜੀ) was the eighth of the Ten Gurus of Sikhism. He became Guru on Sunday, 20 October 1661 following in the footsteps of his father, Guru Har Rai Ji.

When someone asked Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji which of his two sons (Ram Rai and Harkrishan) would be the next Guru, Guru Har Rai asked the person to insert a needle in the leg of the bed (where his two sons sat and recited baani). The person was surprised to see that the needle went into the leg of the bed where Guru Harkrishan Sahib was reciting bani but not where Ram Rai was doing the same. The person, obviously perplexed, asked Guru Har Rai why. Guru Ji explained that although both of them were reciting the same baani, the needle going into the leg of the bed was symbolic of the softness in the heart of Harkrishan. However, Ram Rai had a rougher and tougher heart.

Since the child Guru Harkrishan was to absorb so many diseases into himself, softness was of prime importance. Thus next Guru came to be Guru Harkrishan at the age of 5. This was the first time in history when the light of the Guru had entered such a small child.
