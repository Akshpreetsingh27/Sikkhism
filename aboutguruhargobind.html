      <h1>GURU Hargobind Sahib Ji</h1>
      <p>
        The son of Guru Arjan Dev, ascended the throne of Sikh Guruship on the martyrdom of his father when he was only 11 years old. He was trained in the art of horsemanship, swordsmanship, hunting, and wrestling. Guru Hargobind built Akal Takht as the temporal seat of authority opposite the Golden Temple in Amritsar. He built a small fort, called Lohgarh and kept a small army (cavalry).

The Guru ordained his Sikhs to bring offerings of weapons and horses. So Jehangir (Mughal ruler) imprisoned the Guru in the fort of Gwalior for about 12 years, though later on the Emperor tried to befriend him. Guru Hargobind traveled far and wide including Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. He fought four battles against the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. The Guru lived the last year of his life in meditation, leading a simple life. Finally, he appointed his grandson Har Rai as his successor.
