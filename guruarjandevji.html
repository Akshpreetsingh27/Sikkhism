      <h1>GURU ARJANDEV JI</h1>
      <p>
        Guru Arjan (born 1563, Goindwal, Punjab, India—died May 30, 1606, Lahore, Punjab, Mughal Empire [now in Pakistan]) was the Sikh religion’s fifth Guru (1581–1606) and its first martyr.

Harimandir
HarimandirThe Harimandir, or Golden Temple, at Amritsar.
One of the greatest of the Sikh Gurus, Arjan took over the leadership of the Sikh community from his father, Guru Ram Das, and successfully expanded it. He quickly completed the Harimandir, the Golden Temple, at Amritsar, where all Sikhs could worship as they pleased. He expanded that great Sikh centre commercially and became the first Guru to serve as both temporal and spiritual head of the Sikhs. The social reform and missionary efforts by earlier Gurus were extended under him.

Guru Arjan updated the scriptures of the Sikhs and prepared the Kartarpur Pothi, the volume upon which the canonical Adi Granth, or Guru Granth Sahib (“The Granth as the Guru”), the sacred scripture of the Sikhs, is based. He was also a prolific poet who created hymns of great lyrical quality.
