      <h1>GURU RAMDAS JI</h1>
      <p>
        Born in a humble family, Ram Das (called Jetha) used to devote his spare time to the service of the Guru, after his daily vocation of selling sweetened wheat to the pilgrims at Goindwal. Guru Amardas selected him as his son-in-law and got his daughter Bibi Bhani married to him, finding him handsome young, and obedient.

He has contributed 679 hymns to the Guru Granth Sahib. His poetry is full of Vairagya (detachment), sincerity, and devotion to the Lord, He founded the city of Amritsar (Ramdaspur). He encouraged his followers to join in trade and business including horses. Thus Amritsar grew up in a prosperous city of the North. The Sikhs became good traders in jewelry, embroidery works, and horses, going up to Kabul for business, apart from farming and petty shop-keeping.
