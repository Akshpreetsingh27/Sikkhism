   <h1>GURU HARRAI JI</h1>
      <p>
        Guru Har Rai (born 1630, Punjab, India—died 1661, Punjab) was the seventh Sikh Guru (1644–61).

Guru Har Rais grandfather was Hargobind, the sixth Guru and a great military leader. Guru Har Rai traveled in the Malwa area, where he converted the local Brar tribes to Sikhism. He maintained the sizable order of standing troops that his grandfather had amassed but consistently sought peaceful relations with the reigning Muslim Mughal dynasty. Peace was threatened when the Mughal prince Dārā Shikōh, who was favourably disposed toward non-Muslims and had apparently once been assisted in some capacity (possibly cured from poisoning) by Guru Har Rai, lost the struggle for the throne to his brother, Aurangzeb.

Summoned by the new emperor to explain his relationship with Dārā Shikōh, Guru Har Rai sent his son Ram Rai to represent him. After Aurangzeb questioned him about a line of text in the Adi Granth (the Sikh scripture) that he had found disparaging to Muslims, Ram Rai attempted to appease the emperor by suggesting that the line had been improperly transcribed. Guru Har Rai excommunicated Ram Rai for this action. Shortly before his death, the Guru named his five-year-old son, Hari Krishen, as his successor instead of Ram Rai.
